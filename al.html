                      <h5>Kakkathuruth Island</h5>
                      <p>The Kakkathuruthu Island in Vembanad Lake, Alleppey is accessible by boat and the beauty of the Island is beyond explanation. The coconut trees, paddy fields, toddy tapping, fish farming, fishing, coir making, having food with fresh catch from the backwaters...there are numerous aspects which make Kakkathuruthu special. We have visited the island several times to watch sunset and when its not raining, watching the sunset is just awesome. You will get good fresh tapped toddy and traditional Kerala food like Appam, puttu, Karimeen roast, crab roast, shrimp fry, chicken, duck, pork dishes and though the side dishes are bit spicy, it is really tasty. </p></div>
