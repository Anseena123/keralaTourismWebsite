        <p style="text-align:justify;"> Kozhikode was the capital of Malabar during the time of Sri Samoothiri Maharajas, who ruled the region before the British took over. The city's first recorded contact with Europe was when Vasco da Gama docked at Kappad (18 km north) in May 1498, among the leaders of a trade mission from Portugal.Kozhikode was once a famous cotton-weaving center, and it is remembered as the place of origin of calico, to which it gave its name (i.e., Calicut). The place was an early focus for Arab traders, who first settled there in the 7th century.</p>

            <h5>Kappad Beach</h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Kappad, or Kappakadavu locally, is a beach and village near Koyilandy, in the district Kozhikode, Kerala, India. A stone monument installed by government commemorates the "landing" by Vasco da Gama with the inscription, 'Vasco da Gama landed here, Kappakadavu, in the year 1498'. Small and unassuming, Kappad Beach is famous for being the place where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed with his entourage in 1498. Today, a stone plaque marks the historic event.</p>
